'''For this exercise, you are going to write a program that models the 
basketball shooting game, HORSE.

First, rename this file to horse.py

- This game has two players.
- Players alternate taking shots, and, if they miss, they get a letter.
- For the purposes of this exercise, it will be random whether a player makes
or misses a given shot.'''

# Hints for getting started

# What variables will you need for this program? In other words, what values
# do you need to keep track of? 

# What functions will you need? What, if any, input will each function require? 
# What, if any, output will the function return? What, if any side effects will
# the function have? For example, will any values be changed?

# For Round 1, DO NOT WRITE ANY CODE. Use comments and psuedocode to plan out
# what you are going to do. For example, you could do something like:
# def shoot(player):
#   determines whether player makes or misses shot
#   updates players letters if missed

# I will hit up each group individually after round one and get you set for round 2.
